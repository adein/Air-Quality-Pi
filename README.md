# Air-Quality-Pi
Raspberry Pi project in Python that reads air quality data using a Pimoroni EnviroPlus Hat and publishes via MQTT

## Notes

This project contains python code to repeatedly read and publish air quality sensor values to an MQTT broker. There are also several files for the linux OS on the RaspberryPi to auto-start the script on device boot.

This project was based on some provided sample code to read the Pimoroni Hat sensor values.
